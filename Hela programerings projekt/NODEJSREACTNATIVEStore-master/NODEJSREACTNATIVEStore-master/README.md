# NODEJS-REACTNATIVE-MYSQL Store Example

## Description
This is a project created to give an easy to use example of how to use a `NodeJS server` as a backend to a `React native` front end. We use mysql databases on a local xampp webserver to storage the data.
In the example we have a online shop with products, price and name. You are able to insert, remove, update products in the react app. If you try the app and dont like the interface, bare in mind it is designed and tested on a ipad and therefore optimized for such devices.

## What it is

* **React native**: A React native app whre you can add,remove,update and watch products(name and price) 
* **NodeJs**: A backend which handles the requests regarding the products, started on a order route but it is not relevant.
* **PHPMYADMIN Database**: A sql file which i have had run o an phpmyadmin database, it contains a product tabell with name and price as columns
* **HTML Site**: A easy site with html and javascript that can be used to very easily test your backend and its connections.
* **Documentation**: The most important code is commentated in either English, Swedish or Swenglish
